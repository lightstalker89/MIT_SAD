1.Introduction
	
	The aim of this work is to provide a basic understanding of the principles of V2V and to implement three prototypes for Windows Phone and Android based mobile phones and a rasberry pi.
	Since V2V is a trendsetting and complex topic you can't find much literature. Only a few internet sources currently offer relevant information.
