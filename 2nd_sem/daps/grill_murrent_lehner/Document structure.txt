1.Introduction
	
	Since C2C communication is a trendsetting and complex topic you can't find much literature. Only a few internet sources currently offer relevant information. A standard does not exists yet.
	The aim of this work is to provide a basic understanding of the principles of C2C communication and to implement three prototypes for Windows Phone and Android based mobile phones and a raspberry pi. Furthermore this paper should demonstrate a cheap way for upgrading an ordinary car with a C2C communication system and illustrate the possibilities which customer products are offered for realizing such a system.
