\label{cha:Abstract}
Car2Car (C2C) also known as Vehicle2Vehicle (V2V) Communication is a communication technology that allows vehicles or in the future road signs and other traffic related things to exchange information. The technology was first developed and successfully demonstrated by General Motors in 2005\footnote{http://www.worldcarfans.com/10510278356/general-motors-develops-vehicle-to-vehicle-communication}.
\\
Since C2C communication is a trendsetting and complex topic, only a few internet sources currently offer relevant information about this topic. A standard does not exists yet.\\
The aim of this work is to provide a basic understanding of the principles of C2C communication and to implement three prototypes for Windows Phone and Android based mobile phones and a raspberry pi. Furthermore this paper should demonstrate a cheap way for upgrading an ordinary car with a C2C communication system and illustrate the possibilities which customer products are offered for realizing such a system.
