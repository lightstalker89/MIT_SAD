start script file --> type "python hotSwapping.py" in console window
(Python 3.4.3)

At first you will be asked if you want to execute the program.
When you type "y" and press enter the code of the "importedModule.py" will be called.
(2 times, once for each approach --> see Documentation)

After that you can modify the "importedModule.py". The changes will be loaded before the
next execution. No need to restart the program.
